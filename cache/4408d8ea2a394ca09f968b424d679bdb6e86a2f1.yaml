According to my knowledge, a JSON object should have key-value pairs and arrays. However, the structure provided in the question doesn't adhere to this format. Therefore, I will convert the sentence to the specified format and provide the necessary information. Here is the JSON object for the given sentence:

```json
{
  "chinese": "他們有思考和說話的能力。",
  "english": "They have the ability to think and speak.",
  "pinyin": "tāmen yǒu sīkǎo hé shuōhuà de nénglì。",
  "words": [
    {"ch": "他們", "en": "They", "pi": "tāmen"},
    {"ch": "有", "en": "have", "pi": "yǒu"},
    {"ch": "思考", "en": "think", "pi": "sīkǎo"},
    {"ch": "和", "en": "and", "pi": "hé"},
    {"ch": "說話", "en": "speak", "pi": "shuōhuà"},
    {"ch": "的", "en": "the", "pi": "de"},
    {"ch": "能力", "en": "ability", "pi": "nénglì"}
  ]
}
```
