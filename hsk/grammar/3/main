HSK Level 3: Grammar Points 1-10
1. Using 会 (huì) for Expressing Ability or Future Tense
Explanation: 会 (huì) is used to express the ability to do something (like "can" in English) or to indicate something will happen in the future (like "will" in English).
Syntax/Structure: Subject + 会 + Verb + Object (if any)
Examples:

我会说汉语。
Wǒ huì shuō Hànyǔ.
I can speak Chinese.

他会开车。
Tā huì kāi chē.
He can drive.

明天我会去学校。
Míngtiān wǒ huì qù xuéxiào.
I will go to school tomorrow.

Hint/Caveat: Remember that 会 (huì) can indicate both ability and future events, so context is key to understanding the correct meaning.

2. Using 也 (yě) for "Also" or "Too"
Explanation: 也 (yě) is used to indicate that the same action or state applies to another subject, meaning "also" or "too."
Syntax/Structure: Subject + 也 + Verb/Adjective

Wǒ yě xǐhuān píngguǒ.
I also like apples.

她也在学汉语。
Tā yě zài xué Hànyǔ.
She is also learning Chinese.

他也很高。
Tā yě hěn gāo.
He is also tall.

Hint/Caveat: 也 (yě) is always placed before the verb or adjective in a sentence, unlike in English where "also" can be more flexible in position.

3. Using 比 (bǐ) for Comparisons
Explanation: 比 (bǐ) is used to compare two things, similar to the use of "than" in English.
Syntax/Structure: A + 比 + B + Adjective
Examples:

哥哥比我高。
Gēge bǐ wǒ gāo.
My older brother is taller than me.

今天比昨天冷。
Jīntiān bǐ zuótiān lěng.
Today is colder than yesterday.

Zhè běn shū bǐ nà běn shū guì.
This book is more expensive than that one.

Hint/Caveat: Unlike in English, you do not need to use "more" (更) with 比 (bǐ) when making a comparison in Chinese.

4. Using 过 (guò) for Past Experiences
Explanation: 过 (guò) is used after a verb to indicate that someone has had the experience of doing something in the past.
Syntax/Structure: Subject + Verb + 过 + Object (if any)

我去过中国。
Wǒ qù guò Zhōngguó.
I have been to China.

他吃过北京烤鸭。
Tā chī guò Běijīng kǎoyā.
He has eaten Peking duck.

我们看过那部电影。
Wǒmen kàn guò nà bù diànyǐng.
We have seen that movie.

Hint/Caveat: The use of 过 (guò) indicates past experiences, but it does not specify when the experience happened, just that it has happened at some point.

5. Using 虽然…但是… (suīrán… dànshì…) for "Although...but..."
Explanation: 虽然 (suīrán) means "although," and 但是 (dànshì) means "but." This structure is used to show contrast between two clauses.
Syntax/Structure: 虽然 + Clause 1, 但是 + Clause 2
Examples:

虽然下雨，但是我们还是去公园了。
Suīrán xià yǔ, dànshì wǒmen háishì qù gōngyuán le.
Although it rained, we still went to the park.

虽然他很累，但是他没有休息。
Suīrán tā hěn lèi, dànshì tā méiyǒu xiūxí.
Although he was tired, he didn’t rest.

虽然我喜欢他，但是我们不能在一起。
Suīrán wǒ xǐhuān tā, dànshì wǒmen bùnéng zài yīqǐ.
Although I like him, we cannot be together.

Hint/Caveat: Unlike in English, you cannot omit 但是 (dànshì) or 可是 (kěshì) in Chinese. Both parts of the structure are needed to express the contrast properly.

6. Using 一边…一边… (yībiān… yībiān…) for Simultaneous Actions
Explanation: 一边…一边… (yībiān… yībiān…) is used to indicate that two actions are happening at the same time.

她一边走路，一边打电话。
Tā yībiān zǒulù, yībiān dǎ diànhuà.

Hint/Caveat: This structure is quite straightforward, but make sure that the two actions can logically happen at the same time.

7. Using 又…又… (yòu… yòu…) for Multiple Qualities
Explanation: 又…又… (yòu… yòu…) is used to describe someone or something that has two qualities at the same time, often both positive or both negative.

Hint/Caveat: Make sure the adjectives used are either both positive or both negative to maintain consistency in the description.

8. Using 还是 (háishì) in Statements for "Still"
Explanation: 还是 (háishì) can also be used in statements to mean "still," indicating that a situation has not changed.

他还是那么高。
Tā háishì nàme gāo.
He is still that tall.

Hint/Caveat: Do not confuse this usage of 还是 (háishì) with its use in questions to mean "or." The context will help you determine the correct meaning.

9. Using 还是 (háishì) in Questions for "Or"
Explanation: In questions, 还是 (háishì) is used to offer choices, meaning "or" in English.

10. Using 正在 (zhèngzài) for Ongoing Actions
Explanation: 正在 (zhèngzài) is used to indicate that an action is currently in progress, similar to the present continuous tense in English.

Hint/Caveat: 正在 (zhèngzài) emphasizes that the action is happening right now. It can often be used interchangeably with just 在 (zài), but 正在 adds more emphasis.

她比较喜欢喝茶。
Tā bǐjiào xǐhuān hē chá.
She relatively likes drinking tea.

Hint/Caveat: 比较 (bǐjiào) softens the degree of the adjective, making it less absolute compared to using 很 (hěn), which means "very."

12. Using 多 (duō) in Questions for "How"
Explanation: 多 (duō) is used in questions to ask "how" when inquiring about the degree or extent of something, like "how many" or "how much" in English.

Hint/Caveat: Remember that when asking about quantities or degree, the adjective follows 多 (duō).

Hint/Caveat: Do not confuse this usage of 还是 (háishì) with its usage in questions. Here, it emphasizes the continuity of a situation or action.

14. Using 才 (cái) for Indicating "Only Just"

Hint/Caveat: 才 (cái) emphasizes lateness or that something happened just recently. It contrasts with 就 (jiù), which indicates something happened sooner than expected.

15. Using 就 (jiù) for Indicating "Soon" or "Precisely"
Explanation: 就 (jiù) is used to express that something happened or will happen soon, or to emphasize precision. It can be translated as "just," "soon," or "exactly" depending on context.
