November is a good season because the weather is not too hot. I will stay in Saigon for a few days, then travel to Cambodia. In Cambodia, I want to visit Angkor Wat. Then I will fly to Hanoi. Hanoi is in the north and Ho Chi Minh City is in the south. The weather in Hanoi is slightly colder than in Saigon. In Hanoi, I will rent a motorcycle to tour the countryside. I will go on a 5-day road trip. Then I will return to Hanoi for a two-day boat trip. I'm looking forward to delicious food. I want to eat seafood hotpot. Have you been to Vietnam? </span>
