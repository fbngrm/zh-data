以及
---
The word 以及 (yǐjí) in Chinese is a conjunction that means "and," "as well as," or "along with." It is used to link two or more items, concepts, or clauses that are usually of equal importance. The word 以及 is often used in more formal contexts or in written language, rather than in casual spoken conversation where simpler conjunctions like 和 (hé, "and") might be preferred.

The basic syntax pattern is:
[Noun/Verb Phrase 1] + 以及 + [Noun/Verb Phrase 2]

This pattern can be expanded to include more items:
[Noun/Verb Phrase 1] + [Noun/Verb Phrase 2] + 以及 + [Noun/Verb Phrase 3]

不但 (bùdàn) means "not only" in Chinese and is used to introduce a clause that provides an additional piece of information or an extension to what has been stated previously. It often pairs with 而且 (érqiě) to continue the sentence and add more details or emphasize further.

Basic Syntax
不但 + [Clause 1] + 而且 + [Clause 2]
Examples
他不但会说中文，而且会说英语。

Tā bùdàn huì shuō zhōngwén, érqiě huì shuō yīngyǔ.
He not only speaks Chinese, but also speaks English.
这个城市不但风景美丽，而且交通便利。

Zhège chéngshì bùdàn fēngjǐng měilì, érqiě jiāotōng biànlì.
This city is not only beautiful in scenery but also convenient in transportation.
她不但完成了任务，而且提前完成了。

Tā bùdàn wánchéng le rènwù, érqiě tíqián wánchéng le.
She not only completed the task but also finished it ahead of time.
Key Points
不但 introduces the first part of the sentence, highlighting that there is more to follow.
而且 is used to add further information or emphasize the additional point.
This structure often highlights that the second clause presents a more impressive or unexpected piece of information compared to the first clause.
Using 不但 effectively allows you to present a more nuanced or detailed view in your statements.
